# Popperized CDSE Experiments

The directory contains the experiments we're conducting in the CDSE project managed using the Poppper framework. The wiki for this repostory provides information on how to set up and use popper for running experiments. The following experiments currently exist in the pipelines directory:
  * Data Generator - a synthetic program to generate model data for evaluating modeling algorithms
  * Basebones LAMMPS - XXX


To learn more about a particular experiment, descend into that experiment directory. All experiments are listed under `popperized/pipelines`.
