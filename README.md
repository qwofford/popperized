# Popperized CDSE Experiments

The directory contains the experiments we're conducting in the CDSE project managed using the Poppper framework. The wiki for this repostory provides a wealth of information on how to set up and use popper for running experiments. The following experiments currently exist in the pipelines directory:
  * Data Generator - a synthetic program to generate model data for evaluating modeling algorithms
  * Basebones LAMMPS - XXX
