Reproducing work by Oscar Mondragon. We need to talk about a paper later. It's too early now!

\section*{Introduction}
This stuff is popperized
\section*{Method}
Singularity builds remotely, downloads, runs on local machine. Works on my local computer. Not sure about Wheeler yet.
\section*{Results}
This section is broken down into two sections: one for the results of the random sample experiment itself,  the second for the logs, errors, and outputs of the Popper pipeline itself.
\subsection*{Experiment Results}
The results of the experiment itself may be viewed according to your needs. In this case, results are viewed in this \LaTeX document. The only thing about this document that changes after running the popper pipeline is the histogram seen below. It's easy to imagine scenarios where numeric results and many figures are stored in a file, then inserted into the paper. Some care when writing the paper must be taken to include the falsifiability goals. Clearly stating the implication, experiment result, with case statements to break down whether the newly generated paper does or does not violate evaluation thresholds.

\subsection*{Pipeline Results}
The Popper pipeline generates results from its execution which may be found in your experiment folder under the popper/ directory. This is where you will find my setup and teardown notes, for instance. The popper pipeline will export error files and output files, so you'll want to check both to determine if your run was successful, or where your run failed.

\paragraph{}
Perhaps the most useful tool in creating my own pipeline was the experiment flowchart which popper automatically generates. I based my flowchart and this pipeline structure off the quiho, single-node, experiment. The flowchart generated for this pipeline is below:

\section*{Conclusion}
This experiment is Popperized. It takes some time to do, but it is a one-time time investment on the order of hours which will formalize our approach to reproducibility and enable us to gracefully deploy on many infrastructures.
